NEOART
======

Neoart is a code that calculates the neoclassical transport coefficients for
toroidal geometry

NOTE: This is a work in progress.  At present only download the code if you
know what you are doing (and even then you may be disappointed)

Compilation
-----------

A simple

    make

should do to compile Neoart and the tests.

Building Neoart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make neoart


Building the Matlab interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make matlab

Run matlab and change into the matlab directory.  You should be able to run
neoart in matlab using the wrapper called by the command 'neoart'.  Type 'help
neoart' for more information.

You can test your mexfile compilation by running test1.m in matlab. The output
should be:

ans =

   3.7263e+07


coeff =

    1.1645


vpol =

   4.6578e+03


Compiling and running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tests are located in the tests directory.  To compile and run all tests:

    $ make tests
